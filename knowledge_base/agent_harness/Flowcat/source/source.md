**A native-Rust runtime for real-time voice agents — built to run on your own
infrastructure.** Flowcat carries a phone or WebRTC call through a composable
media pipeline — transport in → VAD / turn-taking → STT · LLM · TTS (or a single
speech-to-speech model) → transport out — as **one self-contained binary you
deploy in your own VPC** (or fully air-gapped). No hosted control plane, no
phone-home, no Python or FreeSWITCH sidecar to operate. You bring your own
provider credentials; a call's audio and data never leave infrastructure you
control.

It is a clean-room, native-Rust counterpart to the design of
[pipecat](https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat): the same `FrameProcessor`
pipeline model and the same provider breadth, packaged for teams that need to
**own the stack** — self-hosted, auditable, and dense enough to run serious call
volume per box. No pipecat code is vendored — see [`NOTICE`](NOTICE).

**▶ Watch the overview:**

**Status:** pre-1.0, building in the open.

> **New here?** → **[`QUICKSTART.md`](QUICKSTART.md)** takes you from `git clone` to
> a running pipeline and a real audio round-trip in about five minutes (no
> credentials), then to a **real agent you talk to in your browser** — define it in
> YAML and run one binary (`flowcat-server`), no Rust required.

## Why Flowcat

Most voice-agent platforms are hosted SaaS: your audio, transcripts, and call
data flow through someone else's cloud, and you pay per minute. Flowcat is the
opposite — **a runtime you own and run yourself**, for teams that can't or won't
put regulated call traffic on a multi-tenant platform and want one auditable
artifact instead of a fleet of services.

### 1. Own your voice stack

Flowcat is a single self-contained binary you deploy in your own VPC — or fully
air-gapped. There is **no Flowcat cloud and no phone-home**: the runtime reads
only its own `FLOWCAT_*` config and talks to the providers *you* configure with
*your* credentials. Pair it with the local STT/TTS/LLM connectors (Whisper,
Kokoro / Piper / XTTS, Ollama) and a call's audio and transcript never leave your
infrastructure. For data-residency, on-prem, and sovereignty requirements
(healthcare, finance, public sector), that's the deployment model itself — not a
checkbox bolted onto a SaaS.

### 2. Long-call memory — without the audio tax

Realtime models re-bill the **whole conversation every turn** — as bulky, expensive
audio — so the usual way to keep long calls affordable, sliding-window compression,
saves money by **discarding the oldest turns** (your agent forgets the account number
from minute one). Flowcat's **ContextRelay** converts that accumulated audio context
into a compact text transcript and reseeds the session: the model re-attends cheap text
(~7× smaller, ~4× cheaper per token) instead of audio, and the **whole conversation
survives**. The live voice path is unchanged — the agent still speaks native audio; the
trade-off is that converted turns carry their words, not their prosody. Off by default,
provider-agnostic. See
[the ContextRelay evaluation](docs/context-relay-evaluation.md).

### 3. pipecat-compatible by design

If you know [pipecat](https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat), you already know
Flowcat. It deliberately mirrors pipecat's architecture and public API model —
the `FrameProcessor` graph, the typed `Frame` taxonomy, the system-frame
priority / interruption model, and the STT/TTS/LLM/realtime service seams. You
bring the same mental model and the **same vendor credentials**; you get a single
static Rust binary instead of a Python process tree. See
[Connectors & providers](#connectors--providers).

### 4. One process, room to scale

Because the media loop is Rust — no garbage collector, no GIL — one Flowcat
process uses every core and holds a **flat p99 from 10 to 2,000 concurrent calls
on a single box**, where an equivalent Python deployment grows a multi-second
tail and needs a worker fleet. Read this as **capacity and operational headroom**,
not as a claim about conversational latency: end-to-end voice latency is
dominated by your STT/LLM/TTS providers (hundreds of ms) and Flowcat can't change
that. What it guarantees is that *the runtime itself* never becomes the
bottleneck or the source of a stall — so you provision fewer boxes and your tail
stays predictable under load. See [Benchmark & capacity](#benchmark--capacity).

### 5. Drive it from Python

You don't have to write Rust. Run Flowcat as a service and drive it from Python
at **turn granularity**: implement your conversation policy as a small HTTP
service (the `RemoteBrain` adapter, `brain-http` feature) and expose your Python
functions as tools over MCP. Your code never touches the per-frame path, so the
capacity profile above is preserved. In-process **PyO3 bindings** are on the
[roadmap](ROADMAP.md). See [Using Flowcat from Python](#using-flowcat-from-python)
and [`examples/`](examples/).

---

## Benchmark & capacity

**What this measures:** how much call volume one box absorbs before the *runtime*
becomes the bottleneck, and how tight the tail stays under load. **What it does
not measure:** end-to-end conversational latency — that's dominated by your
STT/LLM/TTS providers (typically hundreds of ms), and Flowcat doesn't change it.
Read the sub-millisecond figures below as framework/transport overhead — capacity
and reliability headroom — not as the latency a caller hears.

A like-for-like benchmark on a single Azure `Standard_FX16mds_v2` box (16 vCPU):
one Flowcat process (12 cores) vs pipecat in its **real multiprocess
deployment** (12 workers, `SO_REUSEPORT`, one per core — Python given every
advantage). Identical Rust WebSocket + μ-law load generator, full-duplex echo,
50 frames/s/call, 10 s per data point.

### p99 round-trip latency vs concurrent calls

![p99 round-trip latency vs concurrent calls — Flowcat (1 process) stays flat at ≤0.61 ms while pipecat (12 workers) climbs past the 150 ms conversational limit by ~300 calls and reaches 5,673 ms at 1,000 calls](docs/bench-p99-latency.png)

Flowcat's line is flat along the floor; pipecat crosses the ~150 ms
conversational limit at a few hundred calls and reaches multi-second tails by
1,000.

| Concurrent calls | Flowcat (1 process) | pipecat (12 workers) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 250  | **0.59 ms** p99 | 51 ms p99 |
| 500  | **0.51 ms** p99 | 843 ms p99 |
| 1000 | **0.47 ms** p99 | 5,673 ms p99 · 77% throughput |
| 2000 | **0.61 ms** p99 | failing · 41% throughput (982 conns refused) |

### Other measured metrics

| Metric | Flowcat (Rust) | pipecat (Python) | Ratio |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Worst-case p99, 10→2,000 calls | **0.61 ms** | 5,673 ms | — |
| Tail at 500 calls (matched load) | **0.51 ms** | 843 ms | **~1,650× lower** |
| Sustained throughput | **100%** to 2,000 calls | collapses past ~250 | — |
| Per-frame routing (framework floor) | **~0.20 µs** | ~106 µs | ~525× |
| RAM per idle session | **~19.6 KB** | ≤ ~1 MB | ~50× tighter |
| Tasks per session | 7 tokio | 22 asyncio | — |
| Multi-core scaling (1→14 cores) | **8.4×** (no GIL) | n/a (1 core/process) | — |

Full percentile distributions (p50 / p90 / p99 / p99.9 / max), the methodology,
and the phase history are in **[`bench/RESULTS.md`](bench/RESULTS.md)**.

## How to use it

Flowcat is a Cargo workspace of four library crates plus a demo binary. Nothing
networked is in the default build — every provider, transport, and exporter is
an opt-in Cargo feature.

```bash
# Build the whole workspace (default features only → no provider client deps).
cargo build

# Run the full fixture/wire test suite (no network, no credentials).
cargo test

# Build a "fat" binary that pulls in every provider client:
cargo build -p flowcat-services \
  --features stt-all,tts-all,llm-all,realtime-all,obs-all

# The demo binary — two runnable, credential-free demos:
cargo run -p flowcat-cli -- pipeline           # in-process FrameProcessor pipeline
cargo run -p flowcat-cli -- ws-echo --loopback # real WebSocket PCM echo round-trip
```

### Run an agent from a config — no Rust

Don't want to embed Flowcat in a Rust binary? Run **`flowcat-server`**: describe
one agent in a YAML/JSON config (a node/edge graph + the realtime or cascaded
provider topology) and serve it over HTTP — no control plane, no database.

```bash
cargo build --release -p flowcat-server --features webrtc
GOOGLE_API_KEY=… ./target/release/flowcat-server --config deploy/agent.example.yaml
# open http://localhost:6210/ to talk to it (mic + live transcript), or bridge a
# Plivo number to the server's /telephony/ws/plivo/{run_id}
```

Providers are selected **by name** from the config (the `flowcat-services`
factory) and their keys come from the environment; the agent graph is run by
`flowcat-agent`. A Dockerfile, compose file, sample config, and env template are
in [`deploy/`](deploy/). The config schema lives in `flowcat-server/src/config.rs`.

### Embed it in your own service

For full control (custom routing, your own control plane, in-process brain logic),
embed the library and implement three seams:

- **`FrameProcessor` pipeline** — compose `transport.input() → vad → stt → llm →
  tts → transport.output()` (or a single realtime S2S model) into a `Pipeline`,
  drive it with a `PipelineTask` / `PipelineRunner`. Each processor runs in its
  own tokio task behind a bounded channel (natural backpressure).
- **`AgentBrain`** — your conversation decision-making. Flowcat never sees your
  control-plane, REST contract, or database; the brain is a trait seam. (Don't
  want to write Rust? The ready-made `RemoteBrain` adapter implements this seam
  against an HTTP service — see [Using Flowcat from Python](#using-flowcat-from-python).)
- **`SessionSource`** — how a call is bootstrapped and finalized.

The runtime is **provider- and contract-agnostic**: it knows nothing about any
downstream control plane. Full processor-author contract:
[`PROCESSOR-DESIGN.md`](PROCESSOR-DESIGN.md) and
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Feature-flag model

`flowcat-core` defaults to `["sip", "recorder"]` (no HTTP/gRPC/ONNX). Every
provider, transport, and exporter is `dep:`-gated, so adding the 80th provider
costs the default build nothing. Umbrella features (`stt-all`, `tts-all`,
`llm-all`, `realtime-all`, `obs-all`) exist for the CLI and CI. Full enumeration:
[`FEATURES.md`](FEATURES.md).

> The `flowcat` CLI ships two demos (the analogue of pipecat's `examples/`), both
> credential-free and exercised in CI: **`pipeline`** drives a synthetic
> sine-wave source through a composable `FrameProcessor` pipeline in-process
