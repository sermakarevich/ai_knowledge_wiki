**AI agent skills for the personal operator's craft.** Decisions, research, second-brain workflows, content rotation, scenario modeling, CFO cadence, domain hunts, and the meta-skills to author more.

Built for founders and indie operators. Works with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), Codex, Cursor, and other Agent Skills hosts.

**Site:** [maker-skills.com](https://maker-skills.com)

## Install

```bash


# In Claude Code
/plugin marketplace add coreyhaines31/makerskills
/plugin install makerskills@makerskills
```

Or symlink for local dev:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/coreyhaines31/makerskills ~/code/makerskills

## Getting started — 5-minute path

New to the plugin? Do these in order. Everything else can wait until you need it.

**1. Install the plugin** (above), then set the base env var in `~/.zshenv`:

```bash
export MAKERSKILLS_CONFIG="$HOME/.config/makerskills"
```

Reload your shell.

**2. Run your first skill — start with `decide`.** No config required:

```
/decide
```

It'll ask what decision you're facing, pick the right questions from the 37signals framework, and archive the result with a revisit date. **That's the first-touch experience**: any skill in this plugin. Structured input → structured output → written to disk.

**3. Read one SKILL.md** to see the pattern:

```bash
open ~/code/makerskills/skills/decide/SKILL.md
```

Each skill is a workflow doc — you can invoke via `/decide` OR read the SKILL.md and run the steps by hand. The plugin is documentation-first; the automation is a side effect.

**4. Try one more skill** that involves personal config, so you understand the pattern:

```
/paste twitter
```

It'll read your clipboard, strip formatting, warn if over 280 chars, and copy back the cleaned output. First invocation may prompt you to install `pbcopy`-adjacent deps if missing. No config file needed — this is a pure utility.

**5. Now branch out.** Skim [The 21 skills](#the-21-skills) below and pick one that maps to a workflow you're already doing manually. That's the highest-leverage adoption path.

### Meta — extend Claude Code (the `-ify` trifecta)
| Skill | What |
|---|---|
| [`skillify`](./skills/skillify/SKILL.md) | Create, adapt, or update a skill in any sibling repo. Three modes: CREATE (from-chat / from-video / from-dump / from-scratch), ADAPT (port external skill with license check + attribution), UPDATE (improve existing skills with cross-skill propagation + semver discipline). |
| [`toolify`](./skills/toolify/SKILL.md) | Wire up an integration, API, MCP server, or third-party service into a Next.js or Rails project. Interactive wizard for auth, env vars, client wrapper, webhook handling, and smoke-test. |
| [`loopify`](./skills/loopify/SKILL.md) | Set up an agent loop, cron-scheduled task, or recurring workflow. Judgment layer on top of `ScheduleWakeup` / `CronCreate` / `/loop` — picks pattern (dynamic / cron / one-shot), tunes delay for cache windows, enforces idempotency + bail-out conditions. |



### Decision & strategy
| Skill | What |
|---|---|
| [`decide`](./skills/decide/SKILL.md) | 37signals decision framework (38 questions + house additions like Q39 opportunity cost, triaged to 6–8 per decision). Archives with revisit dates. |
| [`business-brainstorm`](./skills/business-brainstorm/SKILL.md) | Pressure-test a new business or product on 9 dimensions. Composes with `deep-research` + `domain`. |
| [`domain`](./skills/domain/SKILL.md) | 11-step .com domain hunt on Laura Roeder's "availability-first, never fall in love with a name" methodology. Multi-tool ensemble: Vercel CLI + whois (per-TLD) + Domainr API + Namecheap API + `rdap.org` (modern TLDs) + `agent-browser` for USPTO trademark screening + aftermarket click-throughs (HugeDomains / Afternic / Sedo / Dan). Handles bare-word + prefix/suffix brainstorming, budget filtering, negotiation guidance, and social handle checks. |
| [`deep-research`](./skills/deep-research/SKILL.md) | Multi-source research with citations + archive. WebSearch, WebFetch, `agent-browser`, `/last30days`, memory. |
| [`unstuck`](./skills/unstuck/SKILL.md) | The roadblock antidote. Classifies what kind of "no" you hit (assumption / framing / gatekeeper / tool / resource / physics), runs targeted lateral-thinking techniques from a 10-technique inventory, 10-angle minimum before evaluating. Agents run it on themselves before reporting any dead end. Upstream of `decide`. |
| [`maker-council`](./skills/maker-council/SKILL.md) | Simulated personal board of advisors — Fried, Musk, Bezos, Jensen, Iger, Graham, Naval, Blakely. Seats 3–5 by question type with a designated dissenter, grounds takes in documented frameworks (optional live-research pass), maps the disagreements, synthesizes a call. Custom members via config dir. |



### Knowledge & content consumption
| Skill | What |
|---|---|
| [`second-brain`](./skills/second-brain/SKILL.md) | Karpathy LLM Wiki workflow over any markdown vault. Capture / compile / query / lint / connect / search. Personal-scope. |
| [`company-brain`](./skills/company-brain/SKILL.md) | Team-scope sibling to second-brain. Structured raw dirs (people / companies / meetings / sops / decisions / customer-language / recurring-questions / sales-objections), multi-author attribution, sensitivity tagging, trust levels + a `/cb review` culling pass so unreviewed or deprecated info never poisons answers, optional auto-sync from Fathom / Gong / Granola / CRM. Backbone for a Company Brain Setup productized service. |
| [`read-book`](./skills/read-book/SKILL.md) | PDFs, EPUBs, MOBI, markdown — chapter-by-chapter notes, quotes, summaries, or spaced-rep study mode. |
| [`watch-video`](./skills/watch-video/SKILL.md) | YouTube, Loom, Vimeo, Riverside, Zoom, MP4. Transcript / visual / multimodal (Gemini-native) modes. |
| [`ingest`](./skills/ingest/SKILL.md) | Raw human input — call transcripts (Grain/Zoom/Granola/Fathom), client texts, emails, voice notes — extracted into decisions, action items (yours vs theirs), filed GitHub issues, vault captures, and a drafted-never-sent reply. Person→project routing via private `people.yaml`. |



### Output & creative
| Skill | What |
|---|---|
| [`jab-hook`](./skills/jab-hook/SKILL.md) | Gary Vee's jab-jab-jab-right-hook rhythm applied to your portfolio rotation on X + LinkedIn via Typefully. |
| [`slide-deck`](./skills/slide-deck/SKILL.md) | Branded React decks (Next.js). "Show, don't tell" narrative pitching, density modes, PPT conversion, Playwright export. |



### Operations & utilities
| Skill | What |
|---|---|
| [`pm`](./skills/pm/SKILL.md) | Kanban (5-column) + Eisenhower across your portfolio. Tool-agnostic adapters (Notion, GitHub, Plane, Linear, Obsidian, manual). |
| [`personal-cfo`](./skills/personal-cfo/SKILL.md) | Personal financial scenarios — house purchase + rental forecasting, monthly cash flow, big-purchase decisions. Household scope. |
| [`company-cfo`](./skills/company-cfo/SKILL.md) | Company / agency CFO workflow — monthly snapshots, weekly cash pulse, scenario projector. Transaction-sum EOM methodology, categorization discipline, forward forecasting. Pulls from bank + payment processor + payroll + expense-mgmt via `toolify`-wired integrations. Team scope. |
| [`paste`](./skills/paste/SKILL.md) | Clean terminal output for 9 destinations (Slack, Notion, Twitter, LinkedIn, email, GitHub, plain, HTML). Secret-detection first. |
| [`social-fetch`](./skills/social-fetch/SKILL.md) | Pull any social post by URL across 10 platforms (X, LinkedIn, IG, TikTok, Bluesky, Reddit, Mastodon, Threads, HN). Strategy chain with free + paid fallbacks. |

## Skills compose

Skills call each other by name. When a skill's job hits an adjacent job, it routes there rather than reimplementing. The most-referenced skills are the "central" ones — expect to touch these first as you adopt:

| Most referenced by siblings | Composes with... |
|---|---|
| **`watch-video`** (54 refs) | `second-brain` (capture summary), `skillify from-video`, `social-fetch` (X/IG/TikTok metadata), `pm` (action items), `decide` (flagged decisions) |
| **`skillify`** (51 refs) | `watch-video` (record → skill), `second-brain` (capture source), `compound-engineering:*` (Anthropic-official skill authoring) |
| **`second-brain`** (48 refs) | `deep-research` (external gaps), `read-book` (highlights → wiki), `watch-video` (summaries → raw), `paste` (clean captures) |
| **`slide-deck`** (38 refs) | `business-brainstorm` (pitch decks), `watch-video` (talk-recording → outline), `second-brain` (wiki as content) |
| **`company-brain`** (33 refs) | `toolify` (wire auto-sync), `loopify` (schedule sync), `deep-research` (external gaps), `decide` (structured archive) |
| **`domain`** (32 refs) | `business-brainstorm` (name after idea passes filter), `toolify` (wire Domainr + Namecheap), `decide` (candidate fork) |

See each skill's `## Composes with` section for the full dependency list.
