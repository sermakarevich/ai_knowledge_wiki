## Introduction

</div>

**DuplexSLA** is a native full-duplex *Speech–Language–Action* foundation model. It unifies listening, speaking, in-conversation planning, and tool calling on a single conversational clock, decoding assistant audio together with a structured action stream on a shared 160 ms chunk timeline.

Recent spoken dialogue models have shifted from turn-based to full-duplex designs, where the model continuously listens to the user while generating responses. However, existing duplex backbones still lack a native channel for in-conversation planning and tool calling, leaving real-time agentic behaviour either tied to turn boundaries or relegated to an external cascade. DuplexSLA closes that gap with a **dual-stream three-channel formulation**:

- **User audio channel** — continuous user audio features at an 80 ms stride.
- **Assistant audio channel** — discrete assistant speech tokens in a *TA4* layout (1 text anchor + 4 audio tokens at a 40 ms stride per chunk).
- **Action channel** — a rate-limited textual stream carrying delayed transcripts, planning text, interaction-control labels, and structured tool calls (≤10 tokens per chunk).

All three channels are decoded jointly by a single backbone, so semantic-driven turn-taking and tool calling happen on the same chunked timeline. The backbone is initialised from [Step-Audio-2-mini](https://github.com/stepfun-ai/Step-Audio2) (~7B parameters) and adapted via continued pretraining (CPT) and post-training on duplex dialogue, turn-taking, and tool-call data.

## Highlights

1. **Semantic-driven turn-taking control.** DuplexSLA emits `pause`, `interrupt`, and `backchannel` decisions internally based on its own semantic state, rather than relying on an external semantic VAD. This removes the latency bound of the detector and folds turn-taking into the model's token-level dynamics.

2. **In-conversation planning and tool calling.** Planning text and structured tool calls are emitted on the action channel without halting assistant audio, so multi-action and backchannel-triggered tool use are interleaved with ongoing speech. Tool calls are anchored to their own chunks on the action channel and can run in semantic order along the user's request.

3. **DuplexSLA-Bench.** A duplex benchmark covering `pause`, `interrupt`, and `backchannel` turn-taking together with three styles of in-conversation tool calling (single-action, multi-action, and backchannel-triggered tool calls), so duplex and agentic capabilities are evaluated jointly.

## Model Usage

> 🚧 Inference code, deployment recipes, and model checkpoints are not yet released. This section will be updated once the artefacts land on Hugging Face.

Planned release artefacts:

- Pretrained DuplexSLA checkpoint on Hugging Face.
- Reference inference / streaming server.
- DuplexSLA-Bench evaluation harness and data.
